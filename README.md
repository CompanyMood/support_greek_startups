# #supportgreekstartups

This is the code behing http://www.support-greek-startups.com 

## Dependencies
* Ruby 2.2.2
* Bundler (who has thought so? :wink:)

## Man this is RAW
Yes indeed, it is.
I will work on it more in the next time but it should be enough to help encouraged developers and designers to contribute.

## Ah, contribution eh?
Yeah, in case you want to support this initiative with some fancy desings, translations (we aren't native english speakers :wink:), bugfixes / reports or even whole features.

This is the way to go:
* Fork the project
* Work in a feature branch
* Create a pull request

*Note: Please add Screenshots into your PR in case you worked on the design itself or your feature contains any design additions. That leads to more shininess :star2: and oversight.*

Thanks in advice and spread the word about this initiative.
